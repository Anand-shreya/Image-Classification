# AI vs Real Image Classifier

This project aims to distinguish between AI-generated and real images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The workflow is divided into three key stages:

1. **Image Scraping**: Collection of a diverse dataset of AI-generated and real images.
2. **Model Training**: Training a CNN to classify images as either AI-generated or real.
3. **Deployment**: Developing an interactive web application using Streamlit for real-time image classification.


## Technologies Used
- Selenium
- Streamlit


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anand-shreya/Image-Classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Image-Classification
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    cd Developement
    streamlit run app_model1.py
    ```

## NOTE
* It's good to create a virtual environment before package installation to manage different versions and to avoid any conflict.

To create and activate a virtual environment, use the following commands:

**Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
**Activation**

On Windows 
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
